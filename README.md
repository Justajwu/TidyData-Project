## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

### Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent
analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

[The source data for this project can be found here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

### Steps to work
1. Download the data source and unzip the data on your local drive. This folder should be called '''UCI HAR Dataset'''
2. Change the directory on line 5 to the location of your '''UCI HAR Dataset''' folder.
3. Run '''source("run_analysis.R")'''

### Project Instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
